title: "Shifting flowering phenology with climate change: a key issue for the
  future of oak forest ecosystems ?"
abstract: The reproduction of many tree species is characterized by masting,
  i.e. very large fluctuations in seed production from one year to the next,
  synchronized between individuals within populations. Although masting plays a
  key role in the dynamics of forest ecosystems, its future in the context of
  climate change remains largely unknown. Based on a large network survey of
  pollen and fruiting dynamics of oak populations in mainland France, combined
  with modeling work, we provide evidence that (i) pollen phenology partly
  controls pollen limitation and then masting in oak and (ii) pollen phenology
  and pollen limitation have evolved differently over the last 30 years
  depending on the regions considered. Our work highlights the urgent need to
  account for floral phenology in setting up accurate scenarios on oak masting
  and the associated ecosystem dynamics.
