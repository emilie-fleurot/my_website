abstract: >-
  Many tree species display masting, i.e., population-scale very large
  inter-annual fluctuations

  in seed production, implying locally synchronized trees. Although masting plays a key role in

  the dynamics of temperate forest ecosystems, its future in the context of climate change

  remains largely unknown.

  Based on empirical datasets from large network survey of pollen and fruiting dynamics of oak

  populations in mainland France, combined with modeling work, we provide evidence that (i)

  flowering phenology partly controls pollen limitation and reproductive failure in oak tree

  populations and (ii) pollen phenology and pollen limitation have evolved over the last 30

  years, yet differently depending on the regions considered.

  Our work highlights the urgent need to account for flowering phenology in setting up accurate

  predictions on the future of masting and that of the forest ecosystem dynamics.
