title: Climate change, shifting flowering phenology and their consequences on
  the reproduction of oak trees
abstract: Many tree species display masting, i.e., population-scale very large
  inter-annual fluctuations in seed production, implying locally synchronized
  trees. Although masting plays a key role in the dynamics of temperate forest
  ecosystems, its future in the context of climate change remains largely
  unknown. Based on empirical datasets from large network survey of pollen and
  fruiting dynamics of oak populations in mainland France, combined with
  modeling work, we provide evidence that (i) flowering phenology partly
  controls pollen limitation and reproductive failure in oak tree populations
  and (ii) pollen phenology and pollen limitation have evolved over the last 30
  years, yet differently depending on the regions considered. Our work
  highlights the urgent need to account for flowering phenology in setting up
  accurate predictions on the future of masting and that of the forest ecosystem
  dynamics.
