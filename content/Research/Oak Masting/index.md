A main focus of my thesis has been the identification of oak masting drivers, first step toward building more accurate models to predict oak masting. Doing so I used a unique 8 years-survey of flower ad fruit production of 150 temperate oak trees (<i>Quercus petraea</i>) located upon 15 sites spread across France. I also used daily and monthly weather data for each sites.
