abstract: Large interannual variation in seed production, called masting, is
  very common in wind-pollinated tree populations and has profound implications
  for the dynamics of forest ecosystems and the epidemiology of certain human
  diseases. 1–5 Comparing the reproductive characteristics of populations
  established in climatically contrasting environments would provide powerful
  insight into masting mechanisms, but the required data are extremely scarce.
  We built a database from an unprecedented fine-scale 8-year survey of 150
  sessile oak trees (Quercus petraea) from 15 populations distributed over a
  broad climatic gradient, including individual recordings of annual flowering
  effort, fruiting rate, and fruit production. Although oak masting was
  previously considered to depend mainly on fruiting rate variations, 6,7 we
  show that the female flowering effort is highly variable from year to year and
  explains most of the fruiting dynamics in two-thirds of the populations. What
  drives masting was found to differ among populations living under various
  climates. In soft-climate populations, the fruiting rate increases initially
  strongly with the flowering effort, and the intensity of masting results
  mainly from the flowering synchrony level between individuals. By contrast,
  the fruiting rate of harsh-climate populations depends mainly on spring
  weather, which ensures intense masting regardless of the flowering
  synchronization level. Our work highlights the need for jointly measuring
  flowering effort and fruit production to decipher the diversity of masting
  mechanisms among populations. Accounting for such diversity will be decisive
  in proposing accurate, and possibly contrasted, scenarios about future
  reproductive patterns of perennial plants with ongoing climate change and
  their numerous cascading effects.
