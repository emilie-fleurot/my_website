  The size of organisms may result from various, sometimes antagonistic forces
  operating on distinct traits, within an evolutionary framework that may also
  be constraining. Morphological allometry, referring to the way trait size
  scales with body size, has been shown to reflect ecological adaptation to the
  mean size of the resource exploited. We examined the allometric relationships
  between rostrum and body size among four insect (Curculio spp.) specialists of
  oak acorns. In all four species, weevil females drill a hole with their
  rostrum prior depositing one or a few eggs inside the seed. The four weevil
  species, that coexist on the same individual trees, displayed partitioned
  egg-laying periods in the year, thereby encountering acorns of different size
  and maturation stage. We found marked differences in the allometric slope
  among females: species laying eggs late in the season had a steeper slope,
  leading to increasingly longer rostrum relative to body length, along with the
  mean size of the growing acorns. Females of the smallest species had the
  longest oviposition period and also had the steepest

  slope, which provided them with the most variable rostrum length, thereby matching the variable size of the resource through time. Our work highlights the need to consider not only the average size but also the degree of variability in resource size to understand the adaptive value of allometric relationships.
